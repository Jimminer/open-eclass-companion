## Information
**This app is currently designed as a companion to the open eclass site and not as a standalone alternative!**  
  
I started developing this app as a university student to help myself and other students stay in touch with their university.  
  
Similar apps do exist but they don't work with every university that uses open eclass. This is because they use the Mobile API provided by open eclass but many universities don't support that feature.  
  
The app is going to be available for _Windows_ and _Android_ devices. There are plans for _MacOS_ and _Linux_ support but **not** iOS.

## Features
- Easy to access message/announcement center
- Notifications for messages, announcements, assignments and excersices
- Downloads for a course's uploaded files
- Customizable calendar with notifications (Optional)

## Downloads
Downloads are not yet available to the public. The app is still being tested and more universities are being implemented.
